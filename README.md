# Airbn Classification
Where will a new guest book their first travel experience?
(A Kaggle Airbnb New User Bookings Competition)


For my second project at Metis I decided to tackle a previous Kaggle competition in which students must determine where a airbnb users will book their first travel experience. You can check out the the rules [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings)

There are three main files to this process which outline the approach to my first supervised learning problem.
1. The understanding python file is a compilation of snippits from my first general understanding ipython notebook. This is a cleaner and more concise representation of the initial workflow. [Understanding](https://github.com/patricknieto/Airbnb_classification/blob/master/Final_understanding.py)
2. The second file, [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/patricknieto/Airbnb_classification/blob/master/session_ft_eng.py), details the steps I took to incorporate the external datasets, manipulate them, and include them as features in my main dataset. 
3. Lastly, [here](https://github.com/patricknieto/Airbnb_classification/blob/master/TestAirbnb.py) is an example of just one of the appraoches I took to machine learning. I ran a Gradient Boosting classifier to make my predictions and determine the important features.
